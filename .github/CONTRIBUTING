# Contributing to Flashdown

We welcome contributions to Flashdown! This document outlines the guidelines
for submitting issues and pull requests.

## Getting Started

* Engage with existing tickets: Before creating a new issue, check existing
tickets to see if your problem or suggestion has already been reported. You can
comment on existing tickets to provide additional information or express your
interest.
* Submit pull requests: We encourage you to submit pull requests for bug
fixes, new features, or improvements.

## Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

* Describe the problem: Clearly describe the issue you're encountering or the
feature you'd like to see. Focus on the problem itself, not your proposed
solution.
* Provide context: If proposing a change, explain the motivation for the change
and any relevant context.
* Use GitHub issues: Report bugs and feature requests by creating issues on the
GitHub repository.

## Community Guidelines

Be respectful and considerate of your fellow contributors.

## Versioning Guidelines

Flashdown loosely follows semantic versioning with some exceptions:

* Internal API: The go package github.com/lugu/flashdown is considered internal
and not subject to semantic versioning.
* Major Version Changes: Incompatible changes related to:
  * Supported platforms
  * Markdown format
  * Database format
  * Keyboard shortcuts
* Minor Version Changes: New user functionality is introduced.
* Patch Version Changes: Backward compatible bug fixes are implemented.

Thank you for contributing!
